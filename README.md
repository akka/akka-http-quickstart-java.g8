## Akka HTTP quickstart in Java

The Akka family of projects is managed by teams at [Lightbend](https://lightbend.com/) with help from the community.

Please see the [quickstart guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-http-quickstart-java/) for a
walk through the code.

You can use [Giter8][g8] to create your own project from the quickstart. Or, download and extract the zip file(https://example.lightbend.com/v1/download/akka-quickstart-scala?name=akka-quickstart-scala) to a convenient location.

Prerequisites:
- JDK 17
- [sbt][sbt] 1.9.6 or higher ([download here][sbt_download])

Open a console and run the following command to apply this template:
 ```
sbt new akka/akka-http-java-seed.g8
 ```

This template will prompt for the following parameters. Press `Enter` if the default values suit you:
- `name`: Becomes the name of the project.
- `organisation`: Provides an organisation name for the project.
- `akka-http-version`: Specifies which version of Akka HTTP should be used for this project.
- `akka-version`: Specifies which version of Akka should be used for this project.

This template comes with example for an Akka HTTP server on Java `QuickstartServer`, along with their respective tests.

Once inside the project folder, to run this code, you can issue the following command to run the server:
```
sbt run
```

This template also provides build descriptors for maven and gradle. You can use any of the following commands to run 
the application:
```
mvn compile
mvn exec:java
```
or
```
gradle run
```
Both commands run `com.lightbend.akka.http.sample.QuickstartServer` by default.
